In this repository, you can find projects and assignments that were assigned in "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" along with my coded Python solutions. Throughout the course, I gained valuable experience in computationally representing abstract problems, creating intelligent problem solving agents, and practically applying computer science and probability theory fundamentals to optimize solutions and time/space complexity.
