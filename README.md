Welcome! My name is Vaibhav and I am currently a graduate student at Rutgers University enrolled in the Master of Business and Science: Data Science program. I created this respository so I can share past and future projects. You'll find a lot of projects focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning because that is one area of data science that I am most interested in.
